# Concurrency Control Implementation for VARM Signing Platform

This document describes the implementation of concurrency control in the VARM Signing Platform's offer signing process.

## Overview

We implemented a concurrency control mechanism to handle race conditions that could occur when multiple users attempt to sign the same offer simultaneously. Although this scenario is unlikely (as most offer links are sent to a single recipient), the solution provides protection against potential data integrity issues.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Concurrency Service

Created a dedicated `concurrencyService.ts` file that provides:

- `signOfferWithConcurrencyControl()`: A wrapper method that enhances the standard `signOffer` with optimistic concurrency control
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff and jitter for handling concurrency conflicts
- Appropriate error handling and logging

### 2. Check-and-Set Pattern

Implemented a check-and-set approach:
- First check if the offer is already signed
- If not, check the current state of the offer again right before updating
- Retry the operation if a concurrency issue is detected

### 3. Handler Integration

Updated the `signOffer` handler to:
- Use the concurrency-controlled version of the signing process
- Import the concurrency service dynamically to prevent circular dependencies
- Properly handle and report errors from concurrent modifications

## Testing

Added comprehensive test cases for concurrent signing scenarios:
- Happy path: Successful signing with no concurrency issues
- Already signed offer detection 
- Successful retry after a concurrency conflict
- Maximum retry exhaustion with appropriate error

## Benefits

This implementation provides:

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensures offer status is always consistent, even with concurrent access
2. **Improved User Experience**: Better error messaging for concurrent access attempts
3. **Resilience**: Automatic retry capability for transient concurrency conflicts
4. **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging for tracking concurrent access patterns

## Future Considerations

While this implementation sufficiently addresses the current needs, future enhancements could include:

1. Server-side timestamp tracking for more precise concurrency control
2. Database-level transactions if the backend is migrated to a transactional database
3. Configurable retry policies based on deployment environment
4. Analytics for tracking the frequency of concurrency issues
